# Project1
Student Academic Resource Portal is a web-based project developed for learning purposes that allows students to access academic resources such as notes, past year question papers, and university-level events through a centralized dashboard. A key feature of the system is that students can submit details of university-level events happening in their colleges, helping students across different colleges and regions stay connected. All event submissions from students are reviewed and approved by an admin before being published on the website. The system follows role-based access control, where only admins can upload notes and past year question papers, ensuring secure and organized content management.
